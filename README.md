🛒 SmartCart Customer Segmentation System
📌 Overview

SmartCart is an unsupervised machine learning project that segments customers into meaningful groups based on their purchasing behaviour, engagement levels, and loyalty indicators. The system helps businesses move beyond generic marketing and adopt data-driven, personalised strategies.

🎯 Problem Statement

SmartCart collected extensive customer data but used the same marketing approach for all users. This resulted in inefficient campaigns, missed high-value customers, and delayed churn detection.
This project solves the problem by applying clustering algorithms to uncover hidden customer patterns
